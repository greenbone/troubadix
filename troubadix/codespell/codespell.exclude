For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version 1.4.7.dfsg1-6+lenny4. Due to a technical problem with the buildd infrastructure the update is not yet available, but will be installed into the archive soon.
For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in version 1.2.4-1etch1. Due to a copy & paste error etch1 was appended to the version number instead of sarge1. Since the update is otherwise technically correct, the update was not rebuilt on the buildd network.
For the old stable distribution (sarge), the update cannot currently be processed on the buildd security network due to a bug in the archive management script. This will be resolved soon. An update for i386 is temporarily available at .
For the oldstable distribution (stretch), some additional config changes to the buildd network are needed (to provide the new Rust-based toolchain needed by ESR68). Packages will be made available when those are sorted out.
For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in version 0.10.10-2sarge9. Due to technical problems with the security buildd infrastructure this update lacks builds for the hppa and sparc architecture. They will be released as soon as the problems are resolved.
For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in version 178-1sarge3. Due to technical problems with the security buildd infrastructure this update lacks a build for the Sun Sparc architecture. It will be released as soon as the problems are resolved.
For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in version 4.0.2-4.1sarge1. Due to technical problems with the security buildd infrastructure this update lacks a build for the Sun Sparc architecture. It will be released as soon as the problems are resolved.

In the crossbeam crate, one or more tasks in the worker queue could have been be popped twice instead of other tasks that are forgotten and never popped. If tasks are allocated on the heap, this could have caused a double free and a memory leak.
In the crossbeam rust crate, the bounded channel incorrectly assumed that Vec::from_iter had allocated capacity that was the same as the number of iterator elements. Vec::from_iter does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the bounded channel reconstructs Vec from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumptions - this is unsound and caused a deallocation with the incorrect capacity when Vec::from_iter had allocated different sizes than the number of iterator elements. The impact on Firefox is undetermined, but in another use case, the behavior was causing corruption of jemalloc structures.
