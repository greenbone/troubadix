# 00000001 This file is used together with the -x flag of codespell to exclude specific known typos
# 00000002 and lines which should be kept. It needs to have the very same syntax (e.g spaces, tabs)
# 00000003 in front or after the line so that codespell is ignoring the line correctly.
# 00000004 nb: Once the whole directory is codespell "free" we might want to generate this file automatically
# 00000005 nb2: The strings before are used like this so we can call "sort | uniq" on the file more easily.
# 00000006 nb3: After adding new entries to this file, it is advised to run:
# 00000007 cat codespell.exclude | sort | uniq > codespellnew.exclude
# 00000008 mv codespellnew.exclude codespell.exclude

A flaw was found in Nettle in versions before 3.7.2, where several Nettle signature verification functions (GOST DSA, EDDSA & ECDSA) result in the Elliptic Curve Cryptography point (ECC) multiply function being called with out-of-range scalers, possibly resulting in incorrect results. This flaw allows an attacker to force an invalid signature, causing an assertion failure or possible validation. The highest threat to this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.(CVE-2021-20305)");

Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory [This CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs, the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver are buffered until the guest is ready to process them. There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default). Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time. (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing.(CVE-2021-28715)

In the crossbeam crate, one or more tasks in the worker queue could have been be popped twice instead of other tasks that are forgotten and never popped. If tasks are allocated on the heap, this could have caused a double free and a memory leak.
In the crossbeam rust crate, the bounded channel incorrectly assumed that Vec::from_iter had allocated capacity that was the same as the number of iterator elements. Vec::from_iter does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the bounded channel reconstructs Vec from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumptions - this is unsound and caused a deallocation with the incorrect capacity when Vec::from_iter had allocated different sizes than the number of iterator elements. The impact on Firefox is undetermined, but in another use case, the behavior was causing corruption of jemalloc structures.

There are some measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can be bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of an interface can stop consuming new packets before it is assumed to have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default). Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate gigabytes of data in that time. (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than one free slot, which may be the case when using GSO, XDP, or software hashing.(CVE-2021-28714)
